# text-area-counter
Text Area Character Counter is a simple web application built using HTML and JavaScript that provides a real-time character counting feature.
It allows users to type a message into a text area while dynamically displaying the number of characters typed and the remaining characters allowed.
The application enforces a maximum character limit (200 characters) by preventing further input once the limit is reached and shows a warning message to improve user experience.
